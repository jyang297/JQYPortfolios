What this demo covers (placeholder):

- **Callback hooks:** log thought → action → observation for each step to see why the agent picked a tool.  
- **Timing info:** measure per-call latency; surface slow tools to optimize later.  
- **Redaction:** mask secrets in logs; only keep hashed user IDs.  
- **UI snippet:** minimal React panel to stream the trace in real time.  
- **Takeaway:** add observability before scaling an agent to production.
